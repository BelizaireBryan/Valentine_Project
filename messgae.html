            Happy Valentine's Day my love, if you're reading this, that means I didn't
            completely mess this up. But in all seriousness, I love you so much. I wake
            up every day lucky to be with you. I'll never know what you saw in me all
            those years ago, but I'll always be grateful you did. I can't imagine my
            life without you. We've been together for so long now, through ups and downs
            and I can honestly say that there's no one I'd rather be with. You're beautiful,
            funny(not too much though), understanding, loving, amazing to be around,
            absolutely gorgeous, smart, creative... I could go on and on forever. It's literally
            the easiest thing in the world to love and I've never been happier.

            Quick break from our regularly scheduled program:
            <br>
            <br>
            I wanted to do a quick little throw-back, Song Analysis, or as I like to call it,
            "These artists keep trying to replicate our love story." Ok so I'm talking about a song by Snoh Aalegra,
            specifically "I Want You Around". I could go on forever about just the title. I know we both say we miss each other, and I know we mean it,
            but it gets really hard sometimes being away from you. Dropping you off that night before you left
            for Philly was the closest I've come to crying in a really long time. And maybe that's normal for other
            people, but you know that's not something that happens to me, often, if at all. Divina, you've left
            such a lasting impact on me and my life and I don't know how I could be the same man without you.
            *Ok I just realized how long this is so I'm going do a pt. 2*

            Song Analysis Pt. 2
            <br>
            <br>
            Ok so let me actually get into the song. I think my favorite lyrics are "Come through, I think I need you here,
            (But) I swear it's hard to keep these feelings to myself, Now you're the one I'm thinking of
            My higher ground, my rocket love, Fuck gravity, I'd rather stay up here,". So we both know that I'm kind of a
            stoic person (between the two of us at least). But baby I can't tell you how fast that dissipates as soon as I'm
            around you. Being with you has allowed me to be comfortable enough to the point where I don't need to do anything
            but be me. And honestly, that opened up another way for me to show my love for you. Whether it's through things like
            sharing food or playing with my hair that seem trivial, they're a big deal to me and I'm glad we can spend those moments together.
            Thank you for all the memories we've shared together and I can't wait to make more as we watch each other grow. I love you so much.
